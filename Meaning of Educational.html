                <div class="lead"><p>Introduction</p><p>Many attempts have been made to define educational technology but with little success.  This is because the term educational technology is relatively new to some; it is synonymous with audio visual aids. To other, educational technology could be referred to as tool technology, yet others call it system technology. The reasons that can be adduced for the misunderstanding are:&nbsp;</p><p>i.	The different concepts that different people hold of education and</p><p>ii.	The different concepts that people hold of technology.  In view of the above reasons, for the meaning of educational technology to be really understood, the meaning of education and technology should be examined in the first instance.</p><p>Meaning of Education</p><p>&nbsp;There are many definitions of educational by different authors, associations and individuals, for the purpose of this&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">discourse, education will be taken to mean all the experiences that an individual is exposed to which brings about positive improvement on his skills, attitudes and knowledge and which leads to the improvement of the environment in which he lives (Salawu, Taiwo&amp;Aremu, 1994).</span><br></p><p><strong>Meaning of Technology</strong></p><p>&nbsp;The word technology has been used to refer to all kinds of concepts so much that it has become necessary for two people using the word to agree on what meaning they are going to adopt at any time if they should understand each other.</p><p>&nbsp;Technology by some is seen as technical gadgets and endless series of buttons that perform wonders once the correct combination or sequences are pressed (Dopemu, 1993).</p><p>&nbsp;In field of education, the meaning of technology has been narrowed down to refer to mechanical tools, recorders of all kinds, television, gadgets and computers. An acceptable definition of technology is the systematic application of scientific knowledge to achieve a particular practical purpose.</p><p>The fact that the definitions of education and technology have generated their own literature suggest that educational technology should be varied and wide as education and technology.</p><p>In the remaining part of this section, the meaning of educational technology as given by different scholars,<span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">authors and associations will be examined.</span></p><p>The term educational technology was first defined in Nigeria in 1967 by the British National Council for Educational Technology as “the development, application and evaluation of systems, techniques and aids on the field of human learning”.  The council further described “technology” as the science of the application of knowledge for practical purposes and hence educational technology would seem to compose the process of applying available knowledge in a systematic way to problems in education and learning.</p><p>The Association for Programmed Learning and Educational Technology (APLET) 1972 described educational technology as the technique of mitigating problems of learning organization, control and logistic by logical analysis and programme construction.</p><p>According to Association for Educational Communication and Technology AECT (1972) of United State of America educational technology is defined as “a complex, integrated process involving people, procedures, ideas, devices and organization for analyzing problems and devising, implementing, evaluating and managing solution to those problems involved in all aspects of human learning”.&nbsp;</p><p>Ogunmilade (1984) asserted that educational technology is systematic approach to utilization of resources and purposive or planned training.  Rowntree (1986) in his own opinion says that educational technology is a rational&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">problem solving approach to education, a way of thinking skeptically and systematically about learning and teaching. While, in the view of Tickton (1970), educational technology is a systematic learning in terms of specific objectives based on research in human and non-human resources to bring about more effective instruction.</span></p><p>Grayson (1972) defines educational technology as a system approach to instruction incorporating specific measurable instructional objectives, diagnostic testing, criteria for students’ performance and the repeated redesign of the curriculum materials until the criteria are achieved.</p><p>Woolman (1971) defined educational technology as a purposeful utilization in combination or separately of objects to increase the effectiveness of the educational process.  In the views of Balogun and Abimbade (2001), educational technology is the facilitation of human learning and communication through broad range of resources.  They further asserted that the meaning of technology is relevant to educational technology as technology is the systematic application of scientific and other organized knowledge to practical skills.  According to Balogun and Abimbade, educational technology is made up of a number of other technologies:  These include&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">a.	the concepts of audio-visual and media technology.</span></p><p>b.	information and communication data technology.</p><p>c.	educational processing and telecommunication.</p><p>d.	systems theory/technology theory.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">e.	application of instructional theory.</span><br></p><p>&nbsp;Educational technology according to Dopemu (1993) can be defined using two approaches:</p><p>1.	The hardware/product approach:  This approach to the definition of educational technology (also known as technology in education) is concerned mainly with what equipment are available for use in aid of instruction. That is, the emphasis is on equipment and materials that can be used to process information.</p><p>2.	The software/process approach:  This is also known as technology of education. This approach has its origin from the contribution of behavioural/social science unlike the product approach which originated from contribution of the physical science.</p><p>&nbsp; The main concern of this approach is how people learn things like motivation, perception, interest, reinforcement and how people learn under different situations and the best to present learning aids to the learners.</p><p>&nbsp; The diagram below fully depict definition of educational technology under two heads as technology in education and technology of education.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>.</p></div>
