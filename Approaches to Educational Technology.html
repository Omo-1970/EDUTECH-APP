                <div class="lead"><p>1.	The Software approach</p><p>2.	The Hardware approach</p><p>3.	Systems approach or the problem solving approach</p><p>4.	Behavioural Science approach</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>The Software Approach</strong></p><p>&nbsp;This approach deals with the application of behavioural sciences.  In this approach, the emphasis is on the importance of aids to teaching and is based on the application of the behavioural science to the problems of education. This approach involves;</p><p>1.	The identification of appropriate aims, goals and objectives.</p><p>2.	The selection of relevant and suitable subject matter.</p><p>3.	The choosing of effective and contrasting learning and teaching strategies, methodologies, activities and experiences.</p><p>4.	The evaluation of the success of the resulting learning outcomes and the effectiveness of the vary strategies employed.</p><p>&nbsp; This approach also describes educational technology as a system of task analysis, behaviour classification and learning exercise design, based on tested principles of learning and behaviour.</p><p><strong>The Hardware Approach</strong></p><p>&nbsp; This approach is also regarded as high technology. The emphasis is on the use of equipment and materials. Hardware approach is also the application of physical science and engineering to the problems of education. The equipment and materials used for teaching here were not originally meant for educational purposes but were adopted and adapted for educational purposes.</p><p>&nbsp; At the low technology end of the spectrum, we have the chalkboards, wall charts, simple models and real objects.  At the intermediate level, we have technological products such as overhead projectors, slide and film projectors, simple teaching machine and other presentation hardware essentially under the control of the teacher.  At high technology end we have radio, television, complex teaching or simulation devices, computer assisted instruction and dial-access information systems.</p><p><strong>The Systems Approach/Problem-Solving Approach</strong></p><p>&nbsp; This approach deals with the application of system analysis to education.  This approach lays emphasis on the process and products of teaching and learning.  Here educational technology is seen as systematically managing instructional media, ideas, physical facilities and others in order to solve various educational problems.  Educational technology therefore includes strategies, activities and all educational processes.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>The Behavioural Science Approach</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong> This approach deals with the application of the knowledge of philosophy of education, sociology of education and psychology of education to solve teaching and learning problems.</p><p>&nbsp; These different approaches to educational technology should not be seen as the different views about educational technology but should be seen as the different stages in the evolution of educational technology.</p><p>&nbsp;Educational technology can also be interpreted to mean</p><p>1.	The systematic analysis of a learning situation</p><p>2.	The selection of objectives</p><p>3.	The selection of technologies and media to produce the agreed objectives.</p><p>4.	The construction of criteria to evaluate the results.</p><p>&nbsp; Four distinct although interrelated areas of activity as a broader concept of educational technology have also been itemized as:</p><p>-	the preparation and use of educational materials</p><p>-	the application of knowledge about teaching and learning</p><p>-	the planning, development and application of curricular</p><p>-	the organization of personnel, resources and teaching activities.</p><p>&nbsp;Educational technology also covers work in the fields of the psychology of learning, educational planning and organization, curriculum development and course design, the production of teaching and learning materials, the storage, retrieval and dissemination of information, the allocation of resources, the costs and effectiveness of media in education, the design of learning spaces and problems of innovation.</p><p>.</p></div>
